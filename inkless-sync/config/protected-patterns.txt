# Inkless Auto-Resolve Patterns
# Files matching these patterns will be auto-resolved with "ours" (inkless) version during merge conflicts
# These are files that are completely inkless-owned and safe to auto-resolve
# Format: One pattern per line, supports glob patterns
#
# NOTE: Files requiring manual review (version files, core Kafka files with inkless modifications)
# should NOT be listed here - they will fall into manual resolution for careful review.
