# Inkless for Apache Kafka

Inkless is not supposed to be a long-term fork. We don't accept patches. The code is open exclusively for information purposes. We actively work on contributing these changes to Apache Kafka, see [KIP-1150: Diskless Topics](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1150%3A+Diskless+Topics).

Each release on version branches represents stable progress of the Inkless implementation on top of the corresponding Kafka version. See [VERSIONING-STRATEGY.md](VERSIONING-STRATEGY.md) for complete details.

## Requirements

- Java 17 or 23 (Java 11 for clients only)
- Scala 2.13.16
- Docker (required for building - jOOQ plugin uses a PostgreSQL container for Flyway migrations and class generation)
- Object storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage)

> **Note:** Any S3-compatible storage backend should work in principle. MinIO has been used for integration testing, though we are evaluating alternatives given [MinIO's recent changes](https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/27742d469462e1561c776f88ca7a1f26816d69e2) to their Docker image and single-node deployment support.
- PostgreSQL (for batch coordinator) or in-memory mode for testing

### Important Notes About Auto-Generated Documentation

**Metrics Documentation:**  
The [metrics.rst](metrics.rst) documentation currently covers only storage backend metrics (S3, Azure, GCS). Additional Inkless-specific metrics (batch coordinator performance, cache hit rates, object cache operations, etc.) are available through JMX but not yet fully documented. Full metrics documentation will be added as the feature matures.

**Topic Configurations:**  
Currently, diskless topics have minimal topic-specific configurations as the feature is being developed for upstream contribution to Apache Kafka. See [topic_configs.rst](topic_configs.rst) for the current configuration options. Additional topic-level configurations may be added as the feature matures.
